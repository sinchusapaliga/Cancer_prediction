# Cancer_prediction

The Cancer Prediction project is a machine learning-based application developed using a Jupyter Notebook. It utilizes a dataset containing medical data to predict the likelihood of cancer occurrence. The project processes and analyzes the data, applies machine learning algorithms, and generates predictions with performance evaluation. The output folder stores generated results like plots and reports.

### Features

Load medical data from a CSV file, preprocess the data, train machine learning models, and predict cancer probability. Visualizes important results and stores outputs. Provides a step-by-step workflow inside a user-friendly Jupyter Notebook environment.

### Code Structure

- **cancer.ipynb**: Main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction logic.
- **data.csv**: Dataset file containing the medical records used for training and testing the model.
- **output/**: Directory for saving generated results.
